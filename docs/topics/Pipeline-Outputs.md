# Pipeline Outputs

This document outlines the outputs of a pipeline and how the API will reference those outputs

## Context

The main use cases for the outputs of each pipeline are:

1) The data object of interest being accessible to the client
2) Any other files (specifically the metadata files for the Data Nutrition Label) being accessible to the client

Refer to [Pipeline Storage](Pipeline-Storage.md) for how the outputs are stored.
